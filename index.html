      <h2>But First, Some General Information</h2>
      <h3 id="about">About Me</h3>
      <p>I am currently a Junior at IACS, and though I don't know exactly what I want to do, I know I am interested in Computer Science, specifically Graphics and Visual Computing. I hope to go to a good Engineering School, such as UMass Amherst or BU. </p>

    <h3>My Projects! </h3>
    <ul>
      <a href="#binary">Binary Search Game</a>
    </ul>
    <h4 id="binary">Binary Search Game</h4>
    <p>In this project, we used pair programming to make a text based game in JS based on Binary Search. We played a game in class to understand the concept and drew out the algorithm four our game with a flow chart. My group chose to make a game where the program would guess the US state that the user thought of. The program would ask the user questions about geography and position of the state relative to other states or geographic features of the US.
      
    </p>
      <p>Binary search is the concept of dividing the amount of items in a list by two until there is only one possibility for what the item could be. What that means to this game and the user interface is that the program asks the user yes or no questions until there is only one possibility for what it could be. For my group, we asked as many questions as we could to divide the possibilities by two, and we would use readyesorno functions to ask a yes or no question. The user would write yes or no depending on how the question related to their state. But there were a couple of times when we needed to divide by 3 or 4. For those cases we would use a readchoice function to choose between different terms assigned to a number. The user would write the number that stood for the term that was correct to the state they chose.</p>
