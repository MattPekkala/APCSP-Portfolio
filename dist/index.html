        <h4 id="binary">Binary Search Game</h4> 
    <p>In this project, we made a text based game in JS based on <u>Binary Search.</u> We played a game in class to understand the concept and drew out the algorithm for our game with a flow chart. My group chose to make a game where the program would guess the US state that the user thought of. The program would ask the user questions about geography and position of the state relative to other states or geographic features of the US. We collaborated on this project by using <u>Pair Programming.</u> We learned about <u>Boolean Expressions and Selection Conditionals</u> to help with the searching process. This project also made us learn a lot about <u>Identifying and Correcting Errors.</u></p>
      <p><u>Binary Search</u> is the concept of dividing the amount of items in a list by two until there is only one possibility for what the item could be. What that means to my group's game and the user interface is that the program asks the user yes or no questions in relation to the state they chose, utilizing readyesorno functions. The user would write yes or no depending on how the question related to their state. <u>Boolean Expressions</u> are used to make the program function differently depending on if the user wrote yes or no. You set a variable to something related to the question. In simple terms, you use if statements and else statements. If statements are used when the user answers yes, the boolean expression is if the variable = true, then do this. Else statements have no boolean expression, because you can assume the variable = false, so so you tell the program to do something differently compared to if the variable is true. <u>Selective Conditionals</u> are functions we used when we needed to divide by 3 or 4. For those cases we would use a readchoice function to choose between different terms assigned to a number. The user would write the number that stood for the term that was correct to the state they chose. <u>Pair Programming</u> is a collaboration method used for writing code. The model for three people in a group is one person actually writing the code, one person supervising the code writer to check for errors, and one person mapping out the path of the code with a flow chart. Our group used <u>Identifying and Correcting Errors</u> when we had written the entire code, and we were testing to make sure the game worked, by testing inputs to see if the game guessed the correct state. When we noticed an error we went to the part of the code where the error occurred and tried to notice if there was something wrong with the code. When we found the error and fixed it, then we checked the game in that spot again to make sure it was fixed.</p>

      <h4 id="portfolio">APCSP Portfolio</h4>

      <p>This project is a portfolio used to showcase our work done in this class. It's also to explain what this class is about. We learned a lot about the <u>Design Process</u> of making a website, and user interface. We learned about <u>Hosting and the Internet</u> with how our website needs a server to be seen by anyone. We learned about the languages <u>HTML and CSS</u> and how they are used in the making of a webpage. We also learned about <u>Researching and Using Libraries</u> to enhance our webpages. This project really challenged my ability to use all three languages to make my portfolio exactly as I want it to be.</p>

      <p><u>Design Process</u> was used when we wanted to plan out how we would implement certain elements into our webpage, and setting SMART goals for the work that we would do on work days. <u>Hosting and the Internet</u> is about hosting your website on a hosting server so it can be viewed on the internet. The hosting server we used is Netlify. We needed to host our source code to a code repository to document changes made to the code and save it in case something goes wrong. The code repository we used in Github.<u>HTML</u> is the language used to get the basic layout of the webpage, making elements and implementing other media where they are meant to go, and putting links. <u>CSS</u> is the language used to make the page look exactly how you want it to. You can take the elements defined in HTML and change things about them, like color, size, adding borders, etc. <u>JS</u> is the language used to make everything work, like menus, downloading libraries, importing media to be put into links, etc. <u>Researching and Using Libraries</u> was not used by me, because I ran out of time. I tried to researching libraries, but I didn't get very far. Libraries are pre coded sections of code that are used to implement difficult things into webpages, like animations, transitions, backgrounds, etc.</p>

      <h4 id ="mash">MASH-Like Game</h4>
      <h3>Working Game</h3>
      <a href ="https://cryptogram-game.netlify.app/">Published Game</a>
      <h3>Source Code</h3>
      <a href ="https://github.com/MattPekkala/mash-like-game-MattPekkala">GitHub Repository</a>
      <h3>Function of my program</h3>
      <p>
My program allows the user to guess a phrase which has been picked from a list in order. The guesses are by letter in the phrase, and each time the user guesses a letter, the line Wrong guess? will update to say yes or no if the guess was wrong or right. When the user has guessed every letter, the line Complete guess? will update to yes. Initially, the user is given a hint about what the phrase is, a list of numbers which equals the phrase but each letter is replaced with a number, a series of input boxes for each unique letter, and a list of question marks for the phrase that updates to show the guessed letters as the user makes guesses. 
      </p>
      <h3>Design Process</h3>
      <p>I broke my design into steps, which include:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Representing the phrases with a list of numbers, with one number per unique letter</li>
        <li>Adding one textbox per unique letter</li>
        <li>Adding a line that represents what has been guessed so far</li>
        <li>Implementing logic to know if the guess is correct or not, as well as complete or not</li>
        <li>Implementing a Next Phrase button which clears everything and goes to the next phrase to guess</li>
        <li>Adding in instructions to be as intuitive as possible</li>
        <li>Adding in the phrases and hints to go along with the phrases</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Code Examples</h3>
      <h4>Code Example 1</h4>
      <h5>Principles in this Example</h5>
      <div class="requirements" style="columns: 2; white-space: nowwrap; pointer-events: none;">
        <div><input type="checkbox"> Correcting Errors</div>
        <div><input type="checkbox" checked> Variables and Assignments</div>
        <div><input type="checkbox" checked> Strings</div>
        <div><input type="checkbox" checked> Lists</div>
        <div><input type="checkbox"> Iteration</div>
        <div><input type="checkbox" checked> Procedures</div>
        <div><input type="checkbox" checked> State</div>
        <div><input type="checkbox"> Callbacks</div>
      </div>
      <h5>What does this code do?</h5>
      <p>This section of code (1) defines two lists (2) sets a state for them both and a third and (3) calls a previous function</p>
      <pre><code id="mashExampleOne" lang="sh"></code></pre>
      <h5>Explanations</h5>
      <p>
        The variables phrases and hints are lists which have items which are all strings, they are defined using quotation marks. The react hook useState sets a current state for the variables phrases, hints, and ans, so that when the user starts guessing, these functions can update. In setting a useState to ans, the function getEmptyAnswer is called with the parameter of phrase, and the value it returns is an array of empty strings for each unique letter in the phrase.
      </p>
      <h4>Code Example 2</h4>
      <h5>Principles in this Example</h5>
      <div class="requirements" style="columns: 2; white-space: nowwrap; pointer-events: none;">
        <div><input type="checkbox"> Correcting Errors</div>
        <div><input type="checkbox" checked> Variables and Assignments</div>
        <div><input type="checkbox"> Strings</div>
        <div><input type="checkbox"> Lists</div>
        <div><input type="checkbox"> Iteration</div>
        <div><input type="checkbox" checked> Procedures</div>
        <div><input type="checkbox"> State</div>
        <div><input type="checkbox" checked> Callbacks</div>
      </div>
      <h5>What does this code do?</h5>
      <p>This section of code (1) defines a new function (2) changes two variables and (3) calls back three functions while changing the same two variables again</p>
      <pre><code id="mashExampleTwo" lang="sh"></code></pre>
      <h5>Explanations</h5>
      <p>
        The new function newPhrase is dependent on the new functions nextPhrase and nextHint. These new functions take the lists phrases and hints, and go to the next string in each list by adding one to the index of phrase and hint in their respective lists. Then setPhrase and setHint update the state of phrase and hint to be the next phrase and next hint as defined in nextPhrase and nextHint. Then setAns updates the state of the variable ans by calling back the function getEmptyAnswer with the parameter of nextPhrase, making ans an array of empty strings for each unique letter in the next phrase, defined by nextPhrase.
      </p>
      <h4>Code Example 3</h4>
      <h5>Principles in this Example</h5>
      <div class="requirements" style="columns: 2; white-space: nowwrap; pointer-events: none;">
        <div><input type="checkbox"> Correcting Errors</div>
        <div><input type="checkbox" checked> Variables and Assignments</div>
        <div><input type="checkbox"> Strings</div>
        <div><input type="checkbox"> Lists</div>
        <div><input type="checkbox" checked> Iteration</div>
        <div><input type="checkbox" checked> Procedures</div>
        <div><input type="checkbox"> State</div>
        <div><input type="checkbox" checked> Callbacks</div>
      </div>
      <h5>What does this code do?</h5>
      <p>This section of code (1) declares a function (2) calls a variable with a parameter (3) declares another variable which calls back a function and (4) uses "map" to repeat a function multiple times</p>
      <pre><code id="mashExampleThree" lang="sh"></code></pre>
      <h5>Explanations</h5>
      <p>The new variable CryptoWord takes the variable "phrase" with the parameter "string" and makes a new variable codeNumbers which calls back the function encrypt of the value of phrase. Then this function returns the variable codeNumbers using "map" which allows the function of codeNumbers to repeat for the entire value of phrase. This would return a list of numbers for each unique letter in the chosen string for phrase.</p>
      <h4>Code Example 4</h4>
      <h5>Principles in this Example</h5>
      <div><input type="checkbox" checked> Correcting Errors</div>
        <div><input type="checkbox" checked> Variables and Assignments</div>
        <div><input type="checkbox"> Strings</div>
        <div><input type="checkbox"> Lists</div>
        <div><input type="checkbox"> Iteration</div>
        <div><input type="checkbox" checked> Procedures</div>
        <div><input type="checkbox"> State</div>
        <div><input type="checkbox" checked> Callbacks</div>
      </div>
      <h5>What does this code do?</h5>
      <p>This section of code (1) creates elements for the functions CryptoGuess and CryptoWord (2) calls a variable with a set value and (3) calls back to a function in a third new element</p>
      <pre><code id="mashExampleFour" lang="sh"></code></pre>
      <h5>Explanations</h5>
      <p>The function CryptoGuess is returned with the value of phrase, and the function answer is set to ans. CryptoWord is also given the value of phrase. A new element for a button is created which calls back the function newPhrase to go to the next phrase. I was having a problem before where the amount of input boxes for every phrase would be equal to the amount needed for the first phrase. This was becase I set CryptoGuess and CryptoWord to just be a string, which was the first phrase. I solved this by setting both of these values to the value of phrase, then setting up a useState function for phrase, in addition to the logic to go to the next phrase with nextPhrase.</p>
